Question_1 : Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer : 

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used by web browsers and web servers to communicate 
and transfer data over the internet. HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP, while HTTP/2 is 
a newer and more advanced version.

Here are some of the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

1.Performance: HTTP/2 was designed to improve performance over HTTP/1.1 by reducing latency and improving 
network utilization. This is achieved through features such as multiplexing, header compression, and server push.

2.Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 allowed only one request per connection at a time, which led to a performance bottleneck.
HTTP/2, on the other hand, supports multiple requests and responses over a single connection, known as
multiplexing, which reduces the number of round-trips required to load a web page.

3.Header Compression: In HTTP/1.1, each request and response included full headers, which could be large and 
repetitive.In HTTP/2, header compression is used to reduce the size of headers, which improves network 
utilization and reduces latency.

4.Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces the concept of server push, which allows the server to send resources to the 
client before the client requests them. This can improve page load times by reducing the number of round-trips 
required to load a page.

5.Security: HTTP/2 requires the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption, whereas HTTP/1.1 does not.
This helps to ensure the security and privacy of data exchanged between the client and server.

Overall, HTTP/2 provides significant improvements in performance and efficiency compared to HTTP/1.1,
making it a better choice for modern web applications.
